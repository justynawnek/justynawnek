# 🌟 Hello! I’m Justyna — Your Data Detective 🕵️‍♂️


## 🎢 My Journey in a Nutshell
Imagine someone who started their career journey in the clouds (literally, with a degree in Air Transport & Logistics Management) and then decided to dive deep into the ocean of data. That's me!

After spending years navigating the world of customer service, I realized that my true passion lies in data—finding patterns, telling stories through numbers, and making decisions based on solid evidence. So here I am, switching lanes and speeding down the data highway, determined to make sense of all the chaos.

## 🛠️ My Data Toolkit
Here’s what you’ll find in my toolkit:

- **📊 Data Viz Extraordinaire**: Turning raw data into compelling stories with **Tableau**, **Looker Studio**, and **Power BI**.
- **🐍 Python Whisperer**: Making data behave with **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib**.
- **🧠 SQL Sleuth**: Querying databases like a pro, because who needs sleep when you have **SQL**?
- **☁️ Big Data Wrangler**: Wrestling with large datasets in **Google BigQuery**.
- **🔍 Problem Solver**: My brain is wired to spot inconsistencies and fix them—before my morning coffee.

## 🛠️ Projects I've Tackled
### 1. **Marketing Campaign CSI 🕵️**
   - **Objective**: Dive into marketing data to find out what worked and what didn't.
   - **Tools**: SQL, Tableau

   - **Tools**: Tableau, Power BI
   - **My Role**: Created visually stunning and highly informative dashboards that cut through the noise.

   - **Objective**: Transform messy data into something beautiful (and useful).
   - **Tools**: Python, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **My Role**: The magician behind the curtain, making sure the data was spotless and the visualizations were on point.

I’m not done yet—far from it. Here’s what I’m currently tackling:
- **🛠️ Advanced SQL Techniques**: Because there's always more to learn.
- **🤖 Dipping My Toes into Machine Learning**: Time to see what all the buzz is about!
- **🌐 Cloud Adventures**: Exploring how to scale data solutions in the cloud.

## 🌍 Beyond the Screen
When I’m not coding or wrangling data, you might find me:
- 🏊‍♂️ Swimming laps and working on my butterfly stroke (because data isn't the only thing I like to smooth out).
- 📚 Diving into books on anything from data science to epic fantasy—yes, I read a lot!
